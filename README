This module provides lookup of SPF records including support for SenderID.
It's thought as an alternative to Mail::SPF in cases, where you don't want to
block waiting for the SPF response but instead want to continue doing other
stuff or doing multiple SPF in parallel w/o using multiple threads or processes.
See perldoc of Mail::SPF::Iterator for more details.
